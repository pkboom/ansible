# Running the Role

## Set role path

We can add this file path to the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file:

```
roles_path=path/to/roles

# Assuming our nginx Role is located at /.ansible/roles/nginx, weâ€™ll be all set to run this
roles_path=~/.ansible/roles
```

## Run command

```sh
# if sudo: "yes" is set, you can omit -s
ansible-playbook -s -k -u vagrant server.yml
```
